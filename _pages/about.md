Hi there, my name is Bingheng Li. Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. student from Michigan State University (MSU), working with Prof. Jiliang Tang. Before studying at MSU, I received my B. Eng. degree with honors in Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. Zhao Kang. Previously, I have enriched my research experience as an intern at  Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and Baidu.

I‚Äôm always open to collaboration. If you want to work with me, please contact me without hesitation!
